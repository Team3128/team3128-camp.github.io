                    them to become aware of and excited about science, technology, engineering and math. We want to provide a safe space
                    where students can explore and develop a passion for new subjects that they might desire to pursue in middle school,
                    high school, and throughout the rest of their lives.

                    <h2>Engaging Challenges in Building Robots</h2>

                    First and foremost, our camp is a robotics camp. Each week, campers split up into teams of 3-5 students and are given various
                    tasks to perform with their robot. To accomplish these tasks, campers must build and program their robot to move, mamiuplate
                    objects, and detect its surroundings in unique (and not always obvious) ways. During the week, teams race against each other
                    to come up with clever and creative ways to accomplish the tasks, and they can learn from each other to learn new perspectives
                    to approach the challenges.

                    <br><br>

                    Throughout the week, camp counselors are always around to help lead campers in the right direction. They provide advice on how
                    to solve problems campers face as well as how to turn their ideas into a working robot. Our goal is to give campers the freedom to
                    explore, create, and innovate and to empower them to bring their imaginations to life through the robots they build.

                    There's nothing like a little friendly competition, right? Campers have the second half of
                    the week to design, build, and program their very own robot to compete against other robots in a specially designed robotics competition
                    game. At the end of the week, campers can showcase their designs to their families in our Family Open House, as well as engage in an
                    friendly but intense competition against other teams of campers to prove their robot.

                        Dodgeball and Tag. We also have indoor activities to stimulate the brains of our campers and
                        counselors and allow them to socialize. Oh yeah, snacks and lunch are also included.

                Campers will be provided with a morning snack and lunch each day, including vegetarian options. Snacks typically consist of a snack such as goldfish, a piece of fruit and a treat (e.g. Rice Crispy Treat or Fruit Snack). At lunchtime we provide a rotating selection of food that may include pizza, sandwiches or prepared food from a local restaurant (e.g. Panda Express, El Pueblo, Chick Fil A). We will always offer salad at lunch as well as a vegetarian option. In addition lunch will also be accompanied by a side such as potato chips and another treat.
